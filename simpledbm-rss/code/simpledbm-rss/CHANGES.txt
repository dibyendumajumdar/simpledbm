1.0.6-BETA:
 * dm: Fixed critical race condition in Buffer Manager.
 * dm: Fixed defect in Log Manager that causes it to run out of buffer space in heavy load.
 * dm: Changed implementation of server instance locking.
 * dm: Added support for log4j. 
 * dm: Various improvements to toString() implementations.

1.0.5-BETA:
 * dm: Added distributionManagement section to the maven pom to fix release:perform.
 
1.0.4-BETA:
 * dm: Rewrote the DeadlockDetector findDeadlockCycle() method.
 * dm: Disabled test case for concurrent server access to same database due to portability issues with file locking behaviour.

1.0.3-BETA:
 * dm: Refactored synthronization code in Buffer Manager, in particular, handling of volatile instance variables.
 * dm: Renamed the property log.disableExplicitFlushRequests to log.explicitFlushRequests.
 * dm: Renamed the property bufferpool.bufferWriterSleepInterval to bufferpool.writerSleepInterval.
 * dm: Reformatted all code using eclipse 3.3 to convert tabs to spaces.
 * dm: Added maven release plugin to pom.xml.

1.0.2-BETA: 10 June 2007:

 * dm: Added a number of delegate methods in Server to simplify the API for clients.
 * dm: Server API simplified by removing accessor methods not required by most use cases.
 * dm: The openScan() method now accepts null key and null location parameters. If these are null,
       the scan starts from the first key in the tree. This similifies the interface for Server as
       there is no need to create minKey or null location.
 * dm: Allowed access to objectRegistry() from Server without a status check on the server, as there are
       legitimate use cases for this operation to occur prior to server start.

 * dm: Insert savepoint and rollback to savepoint (on failure) in index insert and delete methods.
