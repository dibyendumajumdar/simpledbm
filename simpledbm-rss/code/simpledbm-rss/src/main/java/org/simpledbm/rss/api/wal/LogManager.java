/**
 * The Log interface provides a mechanism for creating and reading Log Records.
 * The permitted operations are:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create new Log Records.</li>
 * <li>Request for log records to be flushed to disk.</li>
 * <li>Read Log Records sequentially from a starting point.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Each Log Record is uniquely identified using an {@link Lsn}. The Log
 * implementation does not care about the contents of the log record; this is
 * done to ensure maximum reuse.
 * <p>
 * The interface is pretty abstract and has very little dependency on other
 * modules, thus allowing it to be reused in different contexts.
 * <p>
 * To obtain an instance of Log, you need to first obtain an instance of
 * {@link LogFactory}. A LogFactory implementation provides the
 * {@link org.simpledbm.rss.api.wal.LogFactory#getLog()}
 * method for obtaining an instance of an existing Log.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example of how this is done:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * LogFactory factory = new LogFactoryImpl(); // use default parameters
 * Log log = factory.openLog(null); // use default parameters
 * try {
 *     String s = &quot;hello world!&quot;;
 *     byte[] b = s.getBytes();
 *     Lsn lsn = log.insert(b, b.length);
 *     System.out.println(&quot;Lsn of new record = &quot; + lsn);
 * } finally {
 *     if (log != null)
 *         log.close();
 * }
 * </pre>
