    /**
     * Acquires a lock on an object in the specified mode. 
     * <p>
     * A lock may be acquired in different modes such as Shared, Exclusive,
     * Intention Shared, Intention Exclusive, Shared Intention Exclusive, and Update.
     * The lock mode determines which locks are compatible; multiple transactions
     * can hold locks on an object simultaneously only if those locks are compatible.
     * For example, Shared locks are compatible with each other, but an Exclusive 
     * lock is not compatible with any other lock mode.
     * These rules mean that multiple transactons can hold a Shared lock on an
     * object, but only one transaction can obtain an Exclusive lock on the object.
     * <p>
     * Locks are acquired for a duration. If a lock is requested for
     * {@link LockDuration#INSTANT_DURATION}, then the caller is delayed until the lock 
     * becomes grantable, but the lock is not actually granted. {@link LockDuration#MANUAL_DURATION} locks are
     * released either when the lock has been released as many times as it was acquired,
     * or when the transaction commits. {@link LockDuration#COMMIT_DURATION} locks are 
     * held until the transaction commits. Note that once a lock request is made with
     * COMMIT_DURATION, the lock is not released until the transaction commits, regardless
     * of whether it was originally or subsequently requested for other durations.
     * <p>The transaction that requested a lock
     * is said to be the owner of the lock. The owner parameter is intentionally an opaque type, to reduce
     * dependency between the Locking module and the Transaction module. Lock owner objects
     * must implement the {@link Object#equals(Object)} method. 
     * <p>The object being locked is also opaque to the Locking sub-system.
     * Lockable objects must implement the {@link Object#equals} and {@link Object#hashCode()} methods.
     * <p>The locking system supports lock conversions,
     * whereby if the owner already holds a lock on the object in a particular mode,
     * and subsequently requests another lock on the object in a different mode, the existing lock is 
     * upgraded to the more restrictive of the two, as defined by the lock 
     * conversion matrix in {@link LockMode}. A lock conversion request may also
     * impact the lock duration, if COMMIT_DURATION was specified.   
     * <p>A timeout can be specified. If the value of timeout is -1, the Locking system
     * will wait indefinitely for the lock. This is also known as an unconditional request.
     * If timeout is 0, the Locking system will not
     * wait at all, and return failure if the lock is not immediately grantable. 
     * If timeout is > 0, the Locking system will wait for the specified amount of time
     * (in seconds) before giving up the attempt to acquire the lock.
     * In all cases, if a lock cannot be acquired, an exception will be thrown.
     * Timeouts are indicated by throwing a {@link LockTimeoutException}.
     * 
     * @param owner Prospective owner of the lock, must implement equals() method.
     * @param lockable The object that is to be locked, must implement equals() and hashcode() methods.
     * @param mode The desired lock mode.
     * @param duration The duration for which the lock will be held.
     * @param timeout Either -1, 0, or > 0 value indicating wait forever, nowait, wait specified
     * number of seconds.
     * @return A LockHandle that can be used to further manipulate the lock.
     * @throws LockException Thrown if the lock could not be acquired.
