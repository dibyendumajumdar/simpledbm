 * Interface definition for Compensation log records. Compensation log

 * A to B and then aborted, then the change from B to A is recorded as a
 * Compensation log record. It is redo only, which means that a Compensation log
 * record will never be undone. 
 * <p>In Compensation log records, the undoNextLsn is set to the lsn of the 
 * predecessor of the log record being compensated.
