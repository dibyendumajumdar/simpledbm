<p>Defines the interfaces for Space Manager module. This module is
resposible for managing free space information within a Container.</p>
<p>A Raw Container as created by the {@link org.simpledbm.rss.api.st.StorageContainerFactory} interface is more or less
a stream of bytes. The Space Manager module treats the Raw Container as
an ordered collection of fixed size {@link org.simpledbm.rss.api.pm.Page Page}s. It also distinguishes between different types of pages. A
container managed by the Space Manager module contains at least two
types of pages. Firstly, special pages called Free Space Map Pages are
used to track space allocation within the container. One or two bits are
used to track space for each page within the container. Secondly, data
pages are available for client modules to use. The type of the data page
may be specified when creating a container.</p>
