 * not known whether the tuple insert can proceed, for example, whether primary key constraints are
 * satisfied. The first part of the insert allocates a Location for the tuple and exclusively
 * locks it. Control is then returned to the caller to verify that the tuple insert can proceed.
 * Once it has been determined that the tuple insert can proceed, the {@link #completeInsert()} method
 * should be invoked.
