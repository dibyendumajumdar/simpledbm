/**
 * LockDuration defines how long a lock is to be held. An {@link #INSTANT_DURATION} lock
 * is held only for an instant; its purpose being to delay the caller until the desired lock
 * is grantable. A {@link #MANUAL_DURATION} lock may be released prior to the transaction 
 * completing. Such locks maintain a reference count, so that they are only released
 * when the number of release attempts equals the number of acquire attempts. 
 * A {@link #COMMIT_DURATION} lock is held until the transaction completes and generally 
 * cannot be released early.
