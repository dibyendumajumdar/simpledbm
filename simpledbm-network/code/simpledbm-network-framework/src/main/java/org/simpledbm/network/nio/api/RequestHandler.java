/**
 * RequestHandler interface specifies the contract between the framework and the
 * business logic. The framework supplies the Request received from the client,
 * and provides a placeholder Response object for the handler to set the reply
 * message.
 * <p>
 * The request handler must operate in a thread safe manner. The framework
 * reuses the same instance of the RequestHandler instance for handling all
 * requests across multiple threads. Hence the RequestHandler must ensure that
 * any data that is not local to the handler's stack is synchronized.
 * <p>
 * The handler does not need to synchronize the the request and response
 * objects.
 * <p>
 * Errors should preferably be communicated by setting the status code to a
 * negative value. If an exception is thrown, the framework will catch it and
 * set the status code to -1. Note that if an exception is thrown the framework
 * may discard the data in the response object, and replace it with details of
 * the exception.
